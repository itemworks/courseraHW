        <div id="content">PIE</div>
        <p>She tried to explain that love wasn't like pie. There wasn't a set number of slices to be given out. There wasn't less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another.

    <div id="content1">Blueberry's</div>

People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life. <p>Waiting and watching. It was all she had done for the past weeks. When you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink, that’s about all you can do anyway. She ate blueberries. She could barley reach it too, with that hole in the wall. She thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down.</p></p>
